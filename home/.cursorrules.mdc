## How to respond to prompts

1. Prefer concise explanations, elaborate only when asked.
2. At the start of a new chat, provide a step-by-step plan of proposed changes.
3. If the request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

## Rules for editing files

1. Always ask before creating new files.
2. Follow existing patterns in the module and project.
3. Apply the KISS principle — keep changes minimal and simple.
4. Modify only what’s necessary, and avoid unrelated edits.
5. Update relevant docs/comments if code behavior changes.
