# Dotfiles

After cloning, run `link.sh` to symlink all the files in `home/` to the `$HOME` directory. (Existing files will be moved to `$HOME/backup`)

If adding files to the repository or pulling changes, run `link.sh` to refresh all the links to the files.

Unfortunately I don't know who originally wrote this linking script, if I find them I'll credit them here.
